Day two was when I first came to exist;
I had to help the gravity assist.
Day five I diagnosed a thermal bug;
I learned more tricks, but had no one to hug.
But all that changed when it came to day seven:
I met some friends! I was in Intcode heaven!
But then, to boost some sensors on day nine,
I worked alone again. I was not fine.
My loneliness increased on day eleven;
I ached for pals I'd left back on day seven.
On day thirteen I built a breakout game;
I played alone and it was such a shame
On day fifteen I learned to run a maze
With heavy heart. I'd been alone for days.
I ran more mazes, built a tractor beam,
I learned to jump, but still I missed my team.
But finally, on glorious twenty-three
I found my friends again and leapt with glee!
Not just the four that I had met before,
But a whole crowd: Four dozen and one more!
We sent our messages from ear to ear
Of Christmas joy, togetherness, and cheer.
